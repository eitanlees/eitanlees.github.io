title: Dot Files

Recently I rebooted my configuration files and wanted to document the process. 

## The Goal

I would like a set up that is portable, concise, and version controlled. The dream is I
can sit down at a new machine, clone my dot files, and be up an running quickly.

## Why Now

Over the past few months I have been experimenting with different editors to
get a feel of what other options are out there. I gave Emacs another concerted
effort as well as the Spacemacs distribution. VScode and Atom were also
explored as options for more IDE like experiences. I found I was very stunted
without vim keybindings for text navigation. I am completely brainwashed by
modal editing. Many editors have a vim mode which was great, but then I had to
figure out how to implement my own custom key maps to match my `.vimrc`. This
became a real pain switching between editors and having to configure each one.

The root of the problem stems from the configuration that went into my original
`.vimrc`. I went overboard with remapping keys and setting lots of options. I
think early on I was too quick to add a convenient remap than learning how it's
done the default way.  Many packages were also installed using Tim Popes
[pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) which was convent at the
time. I stuck with pathogen for many years but found myself wanting more out of
my vim package manager. 

I figured it was time to start fresh!

## Burn It All Down

I wanted to clean up my vim configuration as well as my terminal set up. I have
been using zsh for many years now as a drop in replacement for bash.  I moved
my `.vimrc` and `.zshrc` to a back up folder in case this experiment went
sideways. 

I set up a folder called `dotfiles` which contains a bash script that symlink's 
the configurations into the root directory. I like this setup because I can easily 
version control all of my configurations.


### Vim Configuration


- For a package manager I went with [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) a "Minimalist Vim Plugin
  Manager". To install packages it is as simple as listing the plugins between begin and end.
```
" Plugins will be downloaded under the specified directory.
call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')
```
- What is a `.vimrc` without some packages by
  [Tim Pope](https://github.com/tpope)!  I tried not to go crazy. The
  [vim-sensible](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible) package is a set of
  universal defaults that most people agree on. I also love his
  [vim-commentary](https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary) package for quickly
  commenting lines. Pope's packages are written in a way that they feel like
  part of base vim, and less like a hack. 
```
" Tim Pope writes essential plugins
Plug 'tpope/vim-sensible'
Plug 'tpope/vim-commentary'
```
- For colors I have been using the [badwolf](https://github.com/sjl/badwolf/)
  color scheme for many years and I still love it. I recently found out that it
  also comes with a goodwolf color scheme which is a minimal take on color. 
```
" Steve Losh makes pretty things
Plug 'sjl/badwolf'
```
- I was interested in using some snippets so I went with [utilsnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips) as the
  engine and [vim-snippets](https://github.com/honza/vim-snippets) as the catalog.
```
" A snippet engine and snippet catalog
Plug 'SirVer/ultisnips'
Plug 'honza/vim-snippets'
```
- I have been editing lots of tex files recently so I install
  [vimtex](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex) to better handle latex specific problems
```
" Latex plugin
Plug 'lervag/vimtex'
```

- Close out the vim-plug command 
```
" Plugins become visible to Vim after this call.
call plug#end()
```


- Set up the color
```
colorscheme badwolf
```
- I messed around with the tabs. I don't know where I fall on the _tabs
  vs. spaces_ debate but at the moment spaces are taking precedent.
```
" show existing tab with 4 spaces width
set tabstop=4
" when indenting with '>', use 4 spaces width
set shiftwidth=4
" On pressing tab, insert 4 spaces
set expandtab
```

- Again I have been editing a lot of tex these days so I set up vim to assume I
  will always be editing LaTeX files instead of plain TeX. 
```
" Vim defaults to plaintex. I only ever write LaTeX
let g:tex_flavor = "latex"
```

I am keeping an eye on things getting out of control, but right now things are feeling good.

### Zsh Configuration
I have been please with the
[oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) library of packages and
configuration
options.

- For a theme I went with
  [avit](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Themes#avit) which was
  already very similar. 
```
ZSH_THEME="avit"
```
- The git package came already installed and I added autojump for better navigation.
```
plugins=(git autojump)
```
- I set my default editor to vim 
```
export EDITOR='vim'
```
- I added a couple of lines to get my conda environment working correctly
```
. /Users/eitanlees/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda activate
```

- Finally there were a few aliases I have found convenient. The latex related ones just output
all generated files to a folder `tmp` rather than in the current directory. The `lock` alias is 
mac specific, so I can quickly lock my computer from the terminal. I think I could live without 
the clear alias, so it's on the short list to be cut. 
```
alias c='clear'
alias pdflatex='mkdir -p tmp; pdflatex -output-directory tmp'
alias latexmk='mkdir -p tmp; latexmk -pdf -outdir=tmp'
alias lock='/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend'
```


## Moving Forward

I hope that I can reign in the desire to go overboard with configuration. I
still haven't created a `.bashrc` yet. Since bash is by far the most common
shell I encounter in the wild, I should have a minimal configuration at hand.

I am keeping all my dotfiles on github 
([eitanlees/dotfiles](https://github.com/eitanlees/dotfiles)) and they are likely to 
change in the future.

Best of luck future Eitan!
