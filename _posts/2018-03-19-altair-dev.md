Over the past few weeks I have been involved in the development of the Altair 2.0 release. If you
haven't heard about Altair it is a declarative statistical visualization library for Python, based
on [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/) and [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/). As of
writing this post a 2.0 release candidate is available at
[altair-viz.github.io](https://altair-viz.github.io/). I plan to do a more in-depth exploration of
Altair soon but here I wanted to talk about my experience working on an open source project.

### Open Source Community

For many years I have been using open source tools but it wasn't until working on Altair that I had
actually contributed. [Jake Vanderplas](https://github.com/jakevdp), one of the lead developers,
posted 

> In preparation for the Altair 2.0 release, we need some good example visualizations for the
documentation! These could be everything from simple one-panel scatter and line plots, to more
complicated layered or stacked plots, to more advanced interactive features.

I had been using github for a while but mostly for smaller projects and hadn't been exposed to the
mechanics of pull requests and open source development. I followed the instructions from the
[Creating a Simple Github Pull Request](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgbCcBNZcdQ), also from
Jake, and submitted some examples. Within minutes my example was merged! Over the next few days
there was a lot of activity building out examples from the Vega-Lite [Example
Gallery](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/) mostly from myself and another user named
[@afonit](https://github.com/afonit). It was fun to create examples and see what others were making.
For the first time I felt like I was part of the open source community I hear so much about. 

Seeing how a project comes together was a very informative experience. From the documentation to
writing unit tests, it was interesting to see "how the sausage was made". I have been involved in
scientific computing for a few years now but there is still a lot to learn with respect to software
development. I am impressed with the effort of [the carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) to educate
researchers on effective computing skills. 

### Contribute!

If you regularly use open source software consider contributing! There are many ways to contribute
so don't be overwhelmed when faced with a large project. I found helping with documentation
to be a good entry point to get comfortable with the process. Look through the github issues for any
`help wanted` or `good first issue` tags. Even proof reading for typos helps!

Join the open source community and contribute!
