In the previous post I discussed my strategy for building a large modular latex
project.  I realized I never shared any of the actual work I did.  I was the TA
for a course called [ISC-4933: Iterative and Direct Solvers for Linear
Systems](https://github.com/eitanlees/ISC-4933). It was the first time the
course was taught and I was tasked with typing up the lecture notes.  I took
the opportunity sharpen my LaTeX skills and to finally really learn TikZ the
right way!  (I highly recommend reading the tutorials in the [official TikZ
manual](http://www.texample.net/media/pgf/builds/pgfmanualCVS2012-11-04.pdf).)
All of the work was compiled into a single document and put on an [ISC-4933
github page](https://github.com/eitanlees/ISC-4933).  In the interest of
sharing I thought I would post all the figures I created for the course.  

If you find any of these figures useful feel free to use them and let me know
in the comments (as well as if there are any errors)! The source code for every
figure as well as PDF versions are available on the [ISC-4933 github
page](https://github.com/eitanlees/ISC-4933) also. For the motivation and
context surrounding the figure you will have to reference the full text.

Without further delay, all the figures!
