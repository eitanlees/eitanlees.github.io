Hello! I am a graduate student in the department of Scientific Computing at Florida State
University. I am currently doing research with [Dr. Shanbhag](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~sshanbhag/)
on chemical reaction networks and modeling corrosion of Aluminum.

This blog is a work in progress and an experiment. My other website is [eitanlees.com](http://eitanlees.com/)
